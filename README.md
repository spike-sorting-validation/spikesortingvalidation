Spike Sorting Validation
========================

The goal of this package is to gather a set of algorithms or metrics that could be used to validate spike sorting algorithms. The metrics
should be spike-sorting algorithms independent, in order to be as generic as possible. You should be able to find here

* Documentation on the metrics, always with a proper reference
* Methods to generate synthetic datasets, or so-called ground truth
